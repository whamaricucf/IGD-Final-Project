# IGD-Final-Project
I have most of everything written out in comments in terms of how they should/will work. The player movement works, the camera is parented to the player from an isometric top-down angle view.
I don't have any AI currently.
I know what weapons I want to do, but they are not implemented yet.
There are scriptable objects for enemy, weapon, and the player stats which are commented out to say what each stat is meant for.
I also have an idea for level generation but I believe we'll talk about that in class.
