# IGD-Final-Project
Considering I have a HUD already I just added a generic enemy AI that chases the player for now. The enemy will "bounce" in the opposite direction in the direction it's coming from if it collides with the player.
The weapons still need to be programmed. Since in Vampire Survivors the only input is movement, weapons will be based on their own timers and automatically trigger or be constantly active (like garlic armor) w/ a cooldown between doing damage consecutively.
Beyond that, the next steps are actually dealing damage--both to the enemies and the player, experience for gaining levels for weapon and passive upgrades, dealing with rarity values for which upgrades will appear in the upgrade menu, and storing the data for the upgrades/weapons.
